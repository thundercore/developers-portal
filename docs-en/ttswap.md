## Step 2
To start using all services on TTSwap, please click Connect to proceed.

Swap
1. _“Swap”_ is a function that can exchange any two kinds of ERC-20 tokens.

2. After selecting the input and output token to exchange, you can choose to enter an amount in either the "Input" or "Output" blank, and the other blank will immediately calculate the corresponding amount.

* If you click on the “Balance: xxxxx”, TTSwap will automatically fill in the maximum amount based on your balance (0.1 of your balance would be deducted and reserved).


Send
1. “Send” is a function that allows you to send tokens to another address at the same time as the swap is completed.

2. The amount displayed has already deducted the exchange fee.

3. TTSwap will charge a 0.3% fee for each TT ⇄ TT StableCoin transaction. (TT StableCoin ⇄ TT StableCoin's transaction fee will be taken twice, a total of 0.5991%) This fee is called the liquidity provider fee which will be paid to the liquidity providers.
