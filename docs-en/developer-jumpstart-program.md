## What is ThunderCore Developer Jumpstart Program?

### *ThunderCore Developer Jumpstart Program directly funnels active crypto users to your decentralized applications*

In crypto, users are the most valuable asset. ThunderCore directs crypto users to your DApp and helps you with marketing while you are getting started.

The goal of the ThunderCore Developer Jumpstart Program is to get you through the first stage of developing your crypto DApp or building your startup. This means: help your team and your DApp to the point where youâ€™ve built a product impressive enough to sustain itself, make a profit and even raise money on a larger scale.


## More Than Just Grant Money

### *ThunderCore will bring at least 10,000 crypto users to your DApp, is your DApp ready for prime time?*

All successful DApps in crypto needs some combination of users and marketing. In our case, ThunderCore Developer Jumpstart Program gives you the unique opportunity to access both at the same time:

### **1. Access to a pool of active crypto users**

Through the **_Interactive Quests_** in the ThunderCore Hub Quest System, we **directly** incentivize our active user base(25k+ DAU) to visit your DApp and use certain functionalities. There is no better way to access crypto users than this, period.


We are so confident that we can funnel at least 10,000 crypto users to your DApp, and that confidence comes from the fact that ThunderCore has one of the largest active user bases in the entire crypto space, and you can see the success of existing DApps on ranking sites like [DappRadar](https://dappradar.com/rankings/protocol/thundercore) and [dapp.com](https://www.dapp.com/dapps/thundercore).

### **2. Access to our crypto marketing infrastructure**

Through the **_TT Social Promoter_** in the ThunderCore Hub Quest System, users are directly incentivized to help you promote your socials, for instance retweeting a tweet you posted. Users become affiliates and they will help you spread the word and kickstart the network effects. The news of the grand launch of your DApp will be known in no time!
