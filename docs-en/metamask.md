## Getting Started
To use the ThunderCore blockchain (and most other blockchains) you'll need a wallet address. This address works similar to a credit card number.

## MetaMask

MetaMask is a digital wallet that can be used to hold your Thunder Tokens. The following instructions show you how to enable MetaMask for use with the ThunderCore platform.
​
### Install MetaMask

### ​​Known issues with MetaMask
 
Since MetaMask was originally developed for Ethereum, certain info displayed in MetaMask can be somewhat misleading when you are using it for the ThunderCore Mainnet. Notably, there are multiple places in the UI that uses ETH (ether) as the unit, when they are really referring to Thunder Tokens. By extension, the USD numbers are incorrect too, since they are computed using the price of ether.
