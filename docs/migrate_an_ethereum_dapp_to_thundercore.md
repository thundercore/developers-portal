title: Migrate an Ethereum DApp to ThunderCore
---

In this tutorial, we will be migrating an existing decentralized application (DApp) to ThunderCore. We assume that your project has been set up using the popular tool Truffle, though the workflow should be easily adaptable to other tools. If you are having trouble deploying an existing Ethereum DApp to ThunderCore, drop a line at support@thundercore.com and we will be happy to help.

Since ThunderCore is compatible with Ethereum, migrating an existing DApp to ThunderCore is as easy as installing a package and changing a couple of lines in your config.
