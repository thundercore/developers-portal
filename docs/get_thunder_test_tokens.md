# Get Thunder Test Tokens (TST) to Develop on ThunderCore
Hello, ThunderCore Developers!
If you’re planning to develop for ThunderCore, you will need Thunder Test Tokens (TST).
[Use the faucet to request TSTs.](https://faucet.thundercore.com/)

## Install MetaMask
Download MetaMask Google Chrome plugin at [https://metamask.io/](https://metamask.io/). MetaMask is a digital wallet used with decentralized applications (DApps). Make sure to save your password and the seed words.

## Connect to ThunderCore network
- Click on the Network name next to the head of the fox in the upper right corner.
- Select "Custom RPC" from the dropdown list.
- Enter the following RPC connection url: `https://testnet-rpc.thundercore.com:8544`.

## Request faucet funds
- Sign in with an existing account with Google or Github to verify your identity.
- Input the wallet address: the wallet address should already be pre-populated by MetaMask and if it is not, please copy and paste the wallet address from your MetaMask account into the text box (example of wallet address:  0xb73FC0C0961700708967C8fbb3be7e6C049448Ce). Note that these are Thunder Test Tokens (TST), and not Ether.
- Click “Request faucet funds” button.
- Check your MetaMask account to see that it was credited Thunder Test Tokens (TST).

## Known issues with MetaMask
Since MetaMask was originally developed for Ethereum, certain info displayed in MetaMask can be somewhat misleading when you are using it for the Thunder testnet. Notably, there are multiple places in the UI that use ETH (ether) as the unit, when they really are referring to Thunder tokens. By extension, the USD numbers are incorrect too, since they are computed using the price of ether.
