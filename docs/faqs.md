## Pre-release Mainnet

### What does this FAQ address?
ThunderCore launched its Pre-Release Mainnet on February 28th. The timing also coincides with the news release of ThunderCore’s $50 Million funding round. This document answers questions related to the ThunderCore Pre-Release Mainnet.

### What is the Pre-Release Mainnet?
The Pre-Release Mainnet is the ThunderCore Mainnet chain with full functionality. It is different from "public" launch because it lacks the ability for the public to stake tokens, as well as other features.

Public launch of the Mainnet will not impact the Mainnet blockchain in anyway. Which means that the Dapp states, account balances, smart contracts, etc. will be preserved leading into the public launch of the Mainnet. Following this period we will release the full node source code for full public launch.

### Why did you decide to do a pre-launch and release tokens instead of waiting for the actual official mainnet launch?
We decided to do a pre-release of our Mainnet because we wanted users, as well as developers, to experience the thundering speed of the ThunderCore blockchain and to get started on our platform by build DApps with real tokens.

The only difference between now and the public launch will be that the public can easily start participating in the consensus process of the ThunderCore blockchain by running full nodes as well as staking.

### When is the public launch of the ThunderCore Mainnet planned?
ThunderCore is planning for a public launch of its Mainnet in Q3 2019. However it is important to note that the Pre-Release Mainnet contains full functionality.

### How will the public launch of the Mainnet impact the chain?
At the time of public launch, anyone will be able to run a ThunderCore full node. Source code for full node will also be made publicly available.

### Should we anticipate any changes as a result of the public Mainnet launch?
ThunderCore blockchain is live now! It is already producing blocks. The public launch does not involve any alterations to the blockchain. All accounts will preserve their balance. Additionally all DApp states will be preserved.

### How do I get a ThunderCore address?
ThunderCore is Ethereum/EVM compatible. Any address created for Ethereum will work on ThunderCore. One can use MetaMask and any other popular Etheruem wallet to create ThunderCore address. To access the ThunderCore blockchain all one has to do is to point network RPC to [https://mainnet-rpc.thundercore.com](https://mainnet-rpc.thundercore.com) instead of ethereum network. For detailed instructions, please check out: [https://www.thundercore.com/wallet-instructions](https://www.thundercore.com/wallet-instructions)

### How can I get access to ThunderCore?
The ThunderCore Pre-Release Mainnet was recently made available to a set of developers and users. We have observed that the performance continues to meet our expectations and have confidence in the throughput experienced. We would like to expand the group of developers and users on our chain.

ThunderCore is a public chain. The Pre-Release Mainnet is easily accessible via the published network address.

### Where can I buy Thunder Tokens?
Currently, you can purchase Thunder Tokens (TT) on a few major exchanges including Huobi and Upbit. More will be coming, please follow our medium and twitter for annoucements.

If you’re a developer or you just want to experience the thundering speed of ThunderCore, you can get free Thunder Tokens from our [Mainnet Faucet](https://faucet.thundercore.com).
You can also get our test tokens at our [Testnet Faucet](https://faucet-testnet.thundercore.com).

### Is ThunderCore available for DApp development?
Yes. We encourage DApp developers to experience a boost in performance while leveraging full EVM compatibility. DApps can be migrated to ThunderCore in as little as five minutes.

Thunder Tokens can be made available to individuals and teams desiring to try the ThunderCore Mainnet. Additionally, the ThunderCore Testnet has running and available for more than six months for DApp development. You can get started by obtaining free ThunderTokens from the [ThunderCore Mainnet Faucet](https://faucet.thundercore.com). Please also stay on the lookout incentives to port your DApps to ThunderCore.

### Is Thunder Token an ERC-20 token?
No. Thunder Token is the native currency of an independent public blockchain, ThunderCore.

ThunderCore is Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compliant blockchain. Tokens based on ERC-20 standard can be minted and deployed on ThunderCore.

### Is ThunderCore planning an Initial Coin Offering (ICO)?
ThunderCore has completed raising a round of financing via private placement with accredited and experienced blockchain investors. Subsequently, the project will not be conducting an ICO.

### What can I do with Thunder Tokens?
Thunder Token is the native currency of an independent public blockchain, ThunderCore. Thunder Token can be used to build and monetize decentralized applications on the ThunderCore blockchain. Thunder Tokens can be used to pay for gas costs, execute transactions and underwrite smart contracts on the ThunderCore blockchain.

### Why is MetaMask showing my tokens as ETH and a large USD amount as its value?
When adding a custom RPC URL in MetaMask, MetaMask by default treats any token/coin as ETH and shows the portfolio value using the USD price of ETH.

To correct this, use the "Show Advanced Options" menu when adding the custom URL for Thunder Core ([https://mainnet-rpc.thundercore.com](https://mainnet-rpc.thundercore.com)). Add 108 as ChainId and TT as Symbol.

Once you do that your ThunderTokens will appear as TT on the MetaMask.

### How can I send and receive Thunder Tokens (TT)?
You can use any of the existing Ethereum wallets to store, receive and send Thunder Tokens.

Right now you will have to configure most of the wallets to point to custom RPC url of ThunderCore ([https://mainnet-rpc.thundercore.com](https://mainnet-rpc.thundercore.com)).

We are working on getting ThunderCore natively integrated in most popular wallets.

### When will ThunderCore have its own wallet?
ThunderCore is integrating with major wallets to have native support for ThunderCore/ThunderToken.

In the near future, you will not have to deal with custom RPC URL workarounds. We want the ThunderCore experience to be seamless since we want our users to continue using their favorite wallet.

## General 

### What is ThunderCore?
ThunderCore combines high performance with decentralized trust. Made possible by years of rigorous academic research, ThunderCore is an EVM-compatible public blockchain that offers higher throughput, faster confirmation times, and lower costs to make it quick and easy for DApps to deploy and scale.

### Who is the team behind ThunderCore? 
See our [team](https://thundercore.com/team) page.

### What is the roadmap for ThunderCore? 
Testnet went live in July 2018. Pre-Release Mainnet was launched in Feb 2019. Public launch of the Mainnet will be carried out in Q3 2019.

Public launch of the Mainnet in Q3 2019 is code named ThunderCore Jupiter.

Beginning of Q1 2020, ThunderCore Haikili will be released. It will bring features which will make life of developers as well as of end users exponentially easier. Support for cross-chain assets (especially for assets on Ethereum), developer funded gas and blockchain native random number generation will be added.

In Q3 2020, ThunderCore Indra will be released. It will increase the scale of ThunderCore blockchain to 10000+ tx/s. It will also add eWASM support.

In Q2 2021, ThunderCore Raijin will be released and it will allow ThunderCore to use multiple types of public blockchain as the "slow chain".

### How fast is ThunderCore? 
ThunderCore offers confirmation time of 1-2 seconds. ThunderCore achieved a peak transactions per second of over 1,200. You can see live activity and performance on [ThunderScan](https://scan.thundercore.com).

### How can I try ThunderCore?
ThunderTokens (TT) for the ThunderCore Mainnet are available at the [ThunderCore Mainnet Faucet](https://faucet.thundercore.com).

Thunder Test Tokens (TST) are available for free at our Testnet faucet [here](https://faucet-testnet.thundercore.com/). Learn about [how to get Thunder Test Tokens (TST)](get_thunder_test_tokens.md).

To build or migrate DApps, visit our tutorials - [Build](build_a_dapp_on_thundercore_testnet.md) and [Migrate](migrate-to-thunder.md).

You can always review live activity and performance on [ThunderScan(Mainnet)](https://scan.thundercore.com) and [ThunderScan(Testnet)](https://scan-testnet.thundercore.com).

### What type of dApps are a good fit for ThunderCore?
Any dApp which requires some form of real time interaction with its users is a perfect match for ThunderCore. Imagine a blockchain poker game fully hosted on the ThunderCore blockchain.

Additionally DApps which have lot of transactions will be perfectly suited for ThunderCore as gas costs on ThunderCore are 100x cheaper than Ethereum.

### So ThunderCore is just a super fast and low-cost version of Ethereum?
No! ThunderCore is laser focused on making life easier for DApp developers as well as make the blockchain more usable for end users.

Towards that end ThunderCore is working on adding following features natively to the blockchain, besides having high transaction throughput and low gas cost:

1) DApp developer funded gas costs: This feature allows developers to have freemium models for their DApps with select users not needing to even pay for gas when interacting with a DApp.

2) Cross-chain assets on ThunderCore: Being EVM compatible, ThunderCore already makes it super easy for Ethereum developers to port their Eth DApps on ThunderCore. Cross-chain assets allow DApps on ThunderCore to leverage existing Ethereum assets like DAI, Crypto Kitties. Basically DApps can immediately start fully leveraging mature ecosystem of Ethereum while enjoying the scalability and low-cost of ThunderCore.

3) Native random number support: Most gaming applications on any blockchain need random number support. Till now on Ethereum, each DApp has come up with their own scheme for generating random number. ThunderCore blockchain will provide random number generated natively to the DApps or any smart contract.

### What's the Plan for Exchange Listings?
We understand that liquidity is important for the health of the network and ecosystem of developers, users, and retail investors. We understand that blockchain is an experiment of incentives and that the token is what incentivizes participation in the network.

We hear you and we’re working on it. Hang tight and know that we have your back.

### Tell us about your token distribution.
We minted a total of 10,000,000,000 Thunder Tokens divided into the following:

26%, To early investors and adopters<br>
15%, Incentivizing the community and bug bounties<br>
15%, Incentivizing committee members and operators<br>
10%, Incentivizing developers, partners, creators<br>
19%, Retained by ThunderCore for company operations<br>
15%, Incentivizing employees and advisors

### Do you have an ambassador program?
Community-driven growth is important to us and aAmbassadors play a very important part.

This is in the works.

### So, are you guys ThunderCore or Thunder Token? What gives?
Good question.

ThunderCore is the blockchain. Thunder Token is the native currency of the ThunderCore blockchain.

Thunder Token is to ThunderCore what Ether is to Ethereum.

## Technical 

### Is ThunderCore compatible with Ethereum?
ThunderCore and Ethereum use the same virtual machine (EVM). As such, smart contracts that run on Ethereum can run on ThunderCore as well, which means ThunderCore supports languages that Ethereum supports, including Solidity, Vyper, etc.

Furthermore, ThunderCore exposes Ethereum's [JSON RPC](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC), which makes it compatible with tools that use the JSON RPC, such as web3.js, MetaMask, Truffle, etc.

In general, any DApp that runs on Ethereum can be made to run on ThunderCore with very few or no modifications. Visit the [tutorial](migrate-to-thunder.md) on how to migrate from Ethereum to ThunderCore.

### Is ThunderCore decentralized?
Yes, ThunderCore is based on decentralized trust. Users don’t have to trust the consensus nodes nor the accelerator. Users only need to trust the honest majority for ThunderCore to be secure (which is the same for standard blockchains). To understand the consensus algorithm, see [Whitepaper](https://docs.thundercore.com/thunder-whitepaper.pdf).

### Will ThunderCore be open source? 
Yes. We are in process of releasing source code of ThunderCore full node before the public launch of the Mainnet.

### How do I write smart contracts for ThunderCore? 
Since ThunderCore is compatible with Ethereum smart contracts, you can write smart contracts the same way you would for Ethereum. Most people use Truffle, but other tools should work as well. Check out our tutorial on [building DApps on ThunderCore](build_a_dapp_on_thundercore_testnet.md).

### How do I deploy smart contracts for ThunderCore? 
The same way you deploy to Ethereum. Most people use Truffle, but other tools should work as well. See our tutorials on [building](build_a_dapp_on_thundercore_testnet.md) and [migrating Ethereum DApps](migrate-to-thunder.md) to ThunderCore.

### Is there a way to set up a local blockchain similar to the Ganache client? 
Addressed in this [blog](https://medium.com/thundercore/introducing-thundercore-local-chain-af72cae9412f).

### What if I already developed a DApp or smart contracts on Ethereum? 
Since ThunderCore is compatible with Ethereum, it’s easy to migrate DApps and smart contracts to ThunderCore in just a few steps. Check out our [migrate Ethereum DApps to ThunderCore tutorial](migrate-to-thunder.md).

### How much does it cost to use ThunderCore? 
On the ThunderCore Mainnet, Thunder Tokens (TTs) are used to pay gas fees. These gas fees are significantly lower than the fees on Ethereum. Importantly, ThunderCore doesn’t rely on the expensive proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm and is therefore able to produce blocks at a lower cost.

Thunder Test Tokens (TST) are available for free at our testnet faucet here.

### Can I mine or stake Thunder Tokens (TT)?
ThunderCore utilizes Proof of Stake. As such, Thunder Tokens are premined. No new tokens can be mined as we do not mint new tokens as part of our consensus process. ThunderCore validators, called committee node members, earn rewards through gas/txn fees. People can take part in ThunderCore consensus mechanism and participate in securing the ThunderCore blockchain upon its public launch. 

We're working on allowing participation in the network through staking your Thunder Tokens (TT) and we'll let the community know closer to our public launch.

### ThunderCore seems really fast. Is that because it's not decentralized or have dApps yet? Will it slow down once there are actual dApps and users?
ThunderCore is screaming fast. Hands down.

ThunderCore, in our tests, can support north of 1000 tx/s and has max confirmation time of 2-3 seconds. We will need 100x current txn load of Ethereum for the throughput to be fully utilized. Also confirmation times will not change if we get more transactions. 

So, the answer is no. ThunderCore will not slow down once it has more transactions.
