## General 

### What is ThunderCore?
ThunderCore combines high performance with decentralized trust. Made possible by years of rigorous academic research, ThunderCore is an EVM-compatible public blockchain that offers higher throughput, faster confirmation times, and lower costs to make it quick and easy for DApps to deploy and scale.

### Who is the team behind ThunderCore? 
Check out our [team page](https://thundercore.com/team). 

### What is the roadmap for ThunderCore? 
Testnet went live in July 2018. Mainnet will be launched Q1 2019. Regular product updates will be released in the meantime.

### How fast is ThunderCore? 
ThunderCore offeres fast, sub-second confirmation time. ThunderCore achieved a peak transactions per second of over 1,200. You can see live activity and performance on [ThunderScan](https://scan.thundercore.com).

### How can I try Thundercore? 
To view ThunderCore's speed - check out [ThunderChat](https://chat.thundercore.com), a live messaging DApp running on ThunderCore testnet. To post messages, you will need Thunder Test Tokens (TST)--available [here](https://faucet.thundercore.com)--to pay for the gas usage.

To build or migrate DApps, visit our [tutorial](migrate_an_ethereum_dapp_to_thundercore.md).

## Technical 

### Is ThunderCore compatible with Ethereum? 
ThunderCore and Ethereum use the same virtual machine (EVM). As such, smart contracts that run on Ethereum can run on ThunderCore as well, which means ThunderCore supports languages that Ethereum supports, including Solidity, Vyper, etc.
Furthermore, ThunderCore exposes Ethereum's [JSON RPC](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC), which makes it compatible with tools that use the JSON RPC, such as web3.js, MetaMask, Truffle, etc.

In general, any DApp that runs on Ethereum can be made to run on ThunderCore with very few or no modifications. Visit the [tutorial](migrate_an_ethereum_dapp_to_thundercore.md) on how to migrate from Ethereum to ThunderCore.

### Is ThunderCore decentralized?
Yes, ThunderCore is based on decentralized trust. Users don’t have to trust the consensus nodes nor the accelerator. Users only need to trust the honest majority for Thunder to be secure (which is the same for standard blockchains). To understand the consensus algorithm, see the [Whitepaper](https://docs.thundercore.com/thunder-whitepaper.pdf).

### How many nodes does ThuderCore run? 
Testnet is currently running 100 consensus nodes.

### Will ThunderCore be open source? 
Yes. We will release the source code gradually.

### How do I write smart contracts for ThunderCore? 
Since ThunderCore is compatible with Ethereum smart contracts, you can write smart contracts the same way you would for Ethereum. Most people use Truffle, but other tools should work as well. Check out our tutorial on [building DApps on ThunderCore](build_a_dapp_on_thundercore_testnet.md).

### How do I deploy smart contracts for ThunderCore? 
The same way you deploy to Ethereum. Most people use Truffle, but other tools should work as well. See our [tutorial](migrate_an_ethereum_dapp_to_thundercore.md). 

### Is there a way to set up a local blockchain similar to the Ganache client? 
It’s perfectly fine to use ganache itself for local development, since ThunderCore is compatible with Ethereum. In the future, if and when ThunderCore starts to diverge (e.g. by adding more features), we may develop our equivalent of ganache.

### What if I already developed a DApp or smart contracts on Ethereum? 
Since ThunderCore is compatible with Ethereum, it’s easy to migrate DApps and smart contracts to ThunderCore in just a few steps. Check out our [migration tutorial](migrate_an_ethereum_dapp_to_thundercore.md). 

### How much does it cost to use ThunderCore? 
For testnet purposes, Thunder Test Tokens (TST) are free. In the future, Thunder Tokens will be used on mainnet to pay gas fees. These gas fees will be significantly lower than the fees on Ethereum. Importantly, ThunderCore doesn’t rely on the expensive proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm and is therefore able to produce blocks at a lower cost.
