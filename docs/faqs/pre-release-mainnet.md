## What does this FAQ address?
ThunderCore launched its Pre-Release Mainnet on February 28th. The timing also coincides with the news release of ThunderCore’s $50 Million funding round. This document answers questions related to the ThunderCore Pre-Release Mainnet.

## What is the Pre-Release Mainnet?
The Pre-Release Mainnet is the ThunderCore Mainnet chain with full functionality. It is different from the "public" launch because it lacks a few key features, such as the ability for the public to stake tokens.

Public launch of the Mainnet will not impact the Mainnet blockchain in any way, which means that DApp states, account balances, smart contracts, etc. will be preserved. Upon the public release of Mainnet (expected in Q3 2019) we will release the full node source code for the public launch.

## Why did you decide to do a pre-launch and release tokens instead of waiting for the actual official mainnet launch?
We decided to do a pre-release of our Mainnet because we wanted users and developers to be able to experience the thundering speed of the ThunderCore blockchain, and to get started with  building DApps with real tokens on our platform as soon as possible.

The only difference between now and the public launch is that the public will be able to easily participate in the ThunderCore consensus process by running full nodes, and staking.

## When is the public launch of the ThunderCore Mainnet planned?
ThunderCore is planning for a public launch of its Mainnet in Q3 2019. It is important to note, however, that the Pre-Release Mainnet contains full functionality.

## How will the public launch of the Mainnet impact the chain?
At the time of public launch, the chain will continue to operate uninterrupted and anyone will be able to run a ThunderCore full node. Full node source code will be made publicly available at that time.

## Should we anticipate any changes as a result of the public Mainnet launch?
ThunderCore blockchain is live now! It is already producing blocks. The public launch does not involve any alterations to the blockchain. All accounts will preserve their balance and all DApp states will be completely preserved.

## How do I get a ThunderCore address?
ThunderCore is Ethereum/EVM compatible. Any address created for Ethereum will work on ThunderCore. One can use MetaMask and any other popular Etheruem wallet to create ThunderCore address. To access the ThunderCore blockchain all one has to do is to point network RPC to [https://mainnet-rpc.thundercore.com](https://mainnet-rpc.thundercore.com) instead of the ethereum network. For detailed instructions, please check out our tutorial on getting your own [wallet](get-wallet.md)

## How can I get access to ThunderCore?
ThunderCore is a public chain. The Pre-Release Mainnet is easily accessible via the published network addresses found [here](migrate-to-thunder.md).

The ThunderCore Pre-Release Mainnet is available to developers and users. We have observed that the performance continues to meet our expectations and have confidence in the throughput experienced. If you are interested in developing or using the chain, please visit our tutorials on [building](deploy-your-own-game.md) or [migrating](migrate-to-thunder.md) to ThunderCore.

## Where can I buy Thunder Tokens?
Currently, you can purchase Thunder Tokens (TT) on a few major exchanges, including Huobi and Upbit. More will be coming, please follow our [Medium](https://medium.com/thunderofficial) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ThunderProtocol) for announcements.

If you’re a developer or you just want to experience the thundering speed of ThunderCore, you can get free Thunder Tokens from our [Mainnet Faucet](https://faucet.thundercore.com).

You can also get our test tokens at our [Testnet Faucet](https://faucet-testnet.thundercore.com).

## Is ThunderCore available for DApp development?
Yes. We encourage DApp developers to experience a boost in performance while leveraging full EVM compatibility. DApps can be migrated to ThunderCore in as little as five minutes.

Thunder Tokens are available to individuals and teams desiring to try the ThunderCore Mainnet. The ThunderCore Testnet has been running and available since February 2019 for DApp development.  You can get started by obtaining free ThunderTokens from the [ThunderCore Mainnet Faucet](https://faucet.thundercore.com). Please also stay on the lookout for incentives to port your DApps to ThunderCore.

Right now you will have to configure most of the wallets to point to the custom RPC url of ThunderCore (https://mainnet-rpc.thundercore.com).

## Is Thunder Token an ERC-20 token?
No. Thunder Token is the native currency of an independent public blockchain, ThunderCore.

ThunderCore is an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compliant blockchain. Tokens based on the ERC-20 standard can be minted and deployed on ThunderCore.

## Is ThunderCore planning an Initial Coin Offering (ICO)?
ThunderCore has completed raising a round of financing via private placement with accredited and experienced blockchain investors. Subsequently, the project will not be conducting an ICO.

## What can I do with Thunder Tokens?
Thunder Token is the native currency of an independent public blockchain, ThunderCore. Thunder Token can be used to build and monetize decentralized applications on the ThunderCore blockchain. Thunder Tokens can be used to pay for gas costs, execute transactions and underwrite smart contracts on the ThunderCore blockchain.

## Why is MetaMask showing my tokens as ETH and a large USD amount as its value?
When adding a custom RPC URL in MetaMask, MetaMask by default treats any token/coin as ETH and shows the portfolio value using the USD price of ETH.

To correct this, use the "Show Advanced Options" menu when adding the custom URL for Thunder Core ([https://mainnet-rpc.thundercore.com](https://mainnet-rpc.thundercore.com)). Add 108 as ChainId and TT as Symbol.

Once you do that your ThunderTokens will appear as TT on the MetaMask.

## How can I send and receive Thunder Tokens (TT)?
You can use any of the existing Ethereum wallets to store, receive and send Thunder Tokens.

Right now you will have to configure most of the wallets to point to custom RPC url of ThunderCore ([https://mainnet-rpc.thundercore.com](https://mainnet-rpc.thundercore.com)).

We are working on getting ThunderCore natively integrated in most popular wallets.

## When will ThunderCore have its own wallet?

Work is being done to create our own mobile wallet. Stay tuned.
