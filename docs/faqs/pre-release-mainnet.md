## What does this FAQ address?
ThunderCore launched its Pre-Release Mainnet on February 28th. The timing also coincides with the news release of ThunderCore’s $50 Million funding round. This document answers questions related to the ThunderCore Pre-Release Mainnet.

## What is the Pre-Release Mainnet?
The Pre-Release Mainnet is the ThunderCore Mainnet chain with full functionality. It is different from "public" launch because it lacks the ability for the public to stake tokens, as well as other features.

Public launch of the Mainnet will not impact the Mainnet blockchain in anyway. Which means that the Dapp states, account balances, smart contracts, etc. will be preserved leading into the public launch of the Mainnet. Following this period we will release the full node source code for full public launch.

## Why did you decide to do a pre-launch and release tokens instead of waiting for the actual official mainnet launch?
We decided to do a pre-release of our Mainnet because we wanted users, as well as developers, to experience the thundering speed of the ThunderCore blockchain and to get started on our platform by build DApps with real tokens.

The only difference between now and the public launch will be that the public can easily start participating in the consensus process of the ThunderCore blockchain by running full nodes as well as staking.

## When is the public launch of the ThunderCore Mainnet planned?
ThunderCore is planning for a public launch of its Mainnet in Q3 2019. However it is important to note that the Pre-Release Mainnet contains full functionality.

## How will the public launch of the Mainnet impact the chain?
At the time of public launch, anyone will be able to run a ThunderCore full node. Source code for full node will also be made publicly available.

## Should we anticipate any changes as a result of the public Mainnet launch?
ThunderCore blockchain is live now! It is already producing blocks. The public launch does not involve any alterations to the blockchain. All accounts will preserve their balance. Additionally all DApp states will be preserved.

## How do I get a ThunderCore address?
ThunderCore is Ethereum/EVM compatible. Any address created for Ethereum will work on ThunderCore. One can use MetaMask and any other popular Etheruem wallet to create ThunderCore address. To access the ThunderCore blockchain all one has to do is to point network RPC to [https://mainnet-rpc.thundercore.com](https://mainnet-rpc.thundercore.com) instead of ethereum network.

Thunder Token is the native currency of an independent public blockchain, ThunderCore. Thunder Token can be used to build and monetize decentralized applications on the ThunderCore blockchain.

## Why is MetaMask showing my tokens as ETH and a large USD amount as its value?
When adding a custom RPC URL in MetaMask, MetaMask by default treats any token/coin as ETH and shows the portfolio value using the USD price of ETH.

To correct this, use the "Show Advanced Options" menu when adding the custom URL for Thunder Core ([https://mainnet-rpc.thundercore.com](https://mainnet-rpc.thundercore.com)). Add 108 as ChainId and TT as Symbol.

Once you do that your ThunderTokens will appear as TT on the MetaMask.

## How can I send and receive Thunder Tokens (TT)?
You can use any of the existing Ethereum wallets to store, receive and send Thunder Tokens.

Right now you will have to configure most of the wallets to point to custom RPC url of ThunderCore ([https://mainnet-rpc.thundercore.com](https://mainnet-rpc.thundercore.com)).

We are working on getting ThunderCore natively integrated in most popular wallets.

## When will ThunderCore have its own wallet?
ThunderCore is integrating with major wallets to have native support for ThunderCore/ThunderToken.

In the near future, you will not have to deal with custom RPC URL workarounds. We want the ThunderCore experience to be seamless since we want our users to continue using their favorite wallet.
