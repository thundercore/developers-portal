## What is ThunderCore?
ThunderCore combines high performance with decentralized trust. Made possible by years of rigorous academic research, ThunderCore is an EVM-compatible public blockchain that offers higher throughput, faster confirmation times, and lower costs to make it quick and easy for DApps to deploy and scale.

## What is the roadmap for ThunderCore? 
Testnet went live in July 2018. Pre-Release Mainnet was launched in Feb 2019. Public launch of the Mainnet will be carried out in Q3 2019.

Public launch of the Mainnet in Q3 2019 is code named ThunderCore Jupiter.

At the beginning of Q1 2020, ThunderCore Haikili will be released. It will introduce features that make the lives of developers and end users exponentially easier. This includes support for cross-chain assets (especially assets on Ethereum), developer-funded gas, and blockchain-native random number generation.

In Q3 2020, ThunderCore Indra will be released. It will increase the scale of the ThunderCore blockchain to 10000+ tx/s. It will also add eWASM support.

In Q2 2021, ThunderCore Raijin will be released, allowing ThunderCore to use multiple types of public blockchains as the "slow chain".

## How fast is ThunderCore? 
ThunderCore offers confirmation time of 1-2 seconds. ThunderCore achieved a peak transactions per second of over 4,000. You can see live activity and performance on [ThunderScan](https://scan.thundercore.com).

## How can I try ThunderCore?
ThunderTokens (TT) for the ThunderCore Mainnet are available at the [ThunderCore Mainnet Faucet](https://faucet.thundercore.com).

Thunder Test Tokens (TST) are available for free at our Testnet faucet [here](https://faucet-testnet.thundercore.com/). Learn about [how to get Thunder Test Tokens (TST)](get-tokens.md).

You can always review live activity and performance on [ThunderScan(Mainnet)](https://scan.thundercore.com) and [ThunderScan(Testnet)](https://scan-testnet.thundercore.com).

## What type of DApps are a good fit for ThunderCore?
Any DApp which requires some form of real time interaction with its users is a perfect match for ThunderCore. Imagine a blockchain poker game fully hosted on the ThunderCore blockchain.

## So ThunderCore is just a super fast and low-cost version of Ethereum?
No! ThunderCore is laser focused on both making life easier for DApp developers, and making the blockchain more usable for end users.

Towards that end, ThunderCore is working on adding the following features natively to the blockchain, besides having high transaction throughput.

1) DApp developer funded gas costs: This feature allows developers to have freemium models for their DApps with select users not needing to even pay for gas when interacting with a DApp.

2) Cross-chain assets on ThunderCore: Being EVM-compatible, ThunderCore already makes it super easy for Ethereum developers to port their Eth DApps to ThunderCore. Cross-chain assets allow DApps on ThunderCore to leverage existing Ethereum assets like DAI and Crypto Kitties. Basically, DApps will be able to fully leverage the mature ecosystem of Ethereum immediately upon migration while enjoying the scalability of ThunderCore.

3) Native random number support: Most blockchain gaming applications need random number support. Till now on Ethereum, each DApp has come up with their own scheme for generating random numbers. ThunderCore blockchain will provide random numbers generated natively to the DApps, or any smart contract.

## Tell us about your token distribution.
We minted a total of 10,000,000,000 Thunder Tokens divided into the following:

26%, To early investors and adopters<br>
15%, Incentivizing the community and bug bounties<br>
15%, Incentivizing committee members and operators<br>
10%, Incentivizing developers, partners, creators<br>

15%, Incentivizing employees and advisors

## Do you have an ambassador program?
Community-driven growth is important to us and Ambassadors play a very important part.

This is in the works.

## So, are you guys ThunderCore or Thunder Token? What gives?
Good question.

ThunderCore is the blockchain. Thunder Token is the native currency of the ThunderCore blockchain.

Thunder Token is to ThunderCore what Ether is to Ethereum.
