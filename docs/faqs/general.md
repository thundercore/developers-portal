## What is ThunderCore?
ThunderCore combines high performance with decentralized trust. Made possible by years of rigorous academic research, ThunderCore is an EVM-compatible public blockchain that offers higher throughput, faster confirmation times, and lower costs to make it quick and easy for DApps to deploy and scale.

## Who is the team behind ThunderCore? 
See our [team](https://thundercore.com/team) page.

## What is the roadmap for ThunderCore? 
Testnet went live in July 2018. Pre-Release Mainnet was launched in Feb 2019. Public launch of the Mainnet will be carried out in Q3 2019.

Public launch of the Mainnet in Q3 2019 is code named ThunderCore Jupiter.

Beginning of Q1 2020, ThunderCore Haikili will be released. It will bring features which will make life of developers as well as of end users exponentially easier. Support for cross-chain assets (especially for assets on Ethereum), developer funded gas and blockchain native random number generation will be added.

In Q3 2020, ThunderCore Indra will be released. It will increase the scale of ThunderCore blockchain to 10000+ tx/s. It will also add eWASM support.

In Q2 2021, ThunderCore Raijin will be released and it will allow ThunderCore to use multiple types of public blockchain as the "slow chain".

## How fast is ThunderCore? 
ThunderCore offers confirmation time of 1-2 seconds. ThunderCore achieved a peak transactions per second of over 1,200. You can see live activity and performance on [ThunderScan](https://scan.thundercore.com).

## How can I try ThunderCore?
ThunderTokens (TT) for the ThunderCore Mainnet are available at the [ThunderCore Mainnet Faucet](https://faucet.thundercore.com).

Thunder Test Tokens (TST) are available for free at our Testnet faucet [here](https://faucet-testnet.thundercore.com/). Learn about [how to get Thunder Test Tokens (TST)](get-tokens.md).

To build or migrate DApps, visit our tutorials - [Build](build_a_dapp_on_thundercore_testnet.md) and [Migrate](migrate-to-thunder.md).

You can always review live activity and performance on [ThunderScan(Mainnet)](https://scan.thundercore.com) and [ThunderScan(Testnet)](https://scan-testnet.thundercore.com).

## What type of dApps are a good fit for ThunderCore?
Any dApp which requires some form of real time interaction with its users is a perfect match for ThunderCore. Imagine a blockchain poker game fully hosted on the ThunderCore blockchain.

Additionally DApps which have lot of transactions will be perfectly suited for ThunderCore as gas costs on ThunderCore are 100x cheaper than Ethereum.

## So ThunderCore is just a super fast and low-cost version of Ethereum?
No! ThunderCore is laser focused on making life easier for DApp developers as well as make the blockchain more usable for end users.

Towards that end ThunderCore is working on adding following features natively to the blockchain, besides having high transaction throughput and low gas cost:

1) DApp developer funded gas costs: This feature allows developers to have freemium models for their DApps with select users not needing to even pay for gas when interacting with a DApp.

2) Cross-chain assets on ThunderCore: Being EVM compatible, ThunderCore already makes it super easy for Ethereum developers to port their Eth DApps on ThunderCore. Cross-chain assets allow DApps on ThunderCore to leverage existing Ethereum assets like DAI, Crypto Kitties. Basically DApps can immediately start fully leveraging mature ecosystem of Ethereum while enjoying the scalability and low-cost of ThunderCore.

3) Native random number support: Most gaming applications on any blockchain need random number support. Till now on Ethereum, each DApp has come up with their own scheme for generating random number. ThunderCore blockchain will provide random number generated natively to the DApps or any smart contract.

## What's the Plan for Exchange Listings?
We understand that liquidity is important for the health of the network and ecosystem of developers, users, and retail investors. We understand that blockchain is an experiment of incentives and that the token is what incentivizes participation in the network.

We hear you and weâ€™re working on it. Hang tight and know that we have your back.

## Tell us about your token distribution.
We minted a total of 10,000,000,000 Thunder Tokens divided into the following:

26%, To early investors and adopters<br>
15%, Incentivizing the community and bug bounties<br>
15%, Incentivizing committee members and operators<br>
10%, Incentivizing developers, partners, creators<br>
19%, Retained by ThunderCore for company operations<br>
15%, Incentivizing employees and advisors

## Do you have an ambassador program?
Community-driven growth is important to us and aAmbassadors play a very important part.

This is in the works.

## So, are you guys ThunderCore or Thunder Token? What gives?
Good question.

ThunderCore is the blockchain. Thunder Token is the native currency of the ThunderCore blockchain.

Thunder Token is to ThunderCore what Ether is to Ethereum.
