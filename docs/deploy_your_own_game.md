title: Deploy Your Own Game on ThunderCore in Minutes
---
Let's take 5-10 minutes and deploy a complete game powered by Thunder and accessible by your friends
and family - anyone with internet access. We will be launching a simple coin flip game
where the player gets double their bet if the coin lands on the ThunderToken. It will even support
the player doubling up their bet in the case that they should guess incorrectly.


## Getting Started
First we have to setup [Metamask](https://metamask.io/). It will be our wallet and our
access point to the Thunder network. For mobile, you can just download [ThunderHub]()
and navigate to [the game](http://jiang-yifan.github.io) to see the end result of this tutorial.


Once we have this setup, all that is needed is to check out the [repo](https://github.com/jiang-yifan/jiang-yifan.github.io)
and follow the instructions in the readme.

At the end of those instructions, you should be able to access the game with either
your mobile device through ThunderHub or your desktop browser with metamask.
