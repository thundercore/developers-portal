8. Clicking on the account name just below the main address line will copy your address to the clipboard.
 
### ​​Known issues with MetaMask
 
Since MetaMask was originally developed for Ethereum, certain info displayed in MetaMask can be somewhat misleading when you are using it for the ThunderCore Mainnet. Notably, there are multiple places in the UI that uses ETH (ether) as the unit, when they are really referring to Thunder Tokens. By extension, the USD numbers are incorrect too, since they are computed using the price of ether.

## Ledger Nano S
This guide will help you set up Hardware Wallet Support for the Ledger Nano S.
